        <p>
          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to
          making science accessible to all. Over the course of human history,
          science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,
          water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the
          very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to
          create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
          discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the
          exploration of the world around us. We believe science should not be
          confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This
          is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
          subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed
          for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life
          (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only come to life at night
          when everyone's gone home).

          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power
