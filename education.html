        <h2>For kids</h2>
        <p>
          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there's plenty to see and do. You can learn about
          Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in
          time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed
          to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to
          learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which meets once
          a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll get to
          explore and experiment with our team of experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can
          join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each
          holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the
          holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

          <h3 class="volunteer">Volunteer</h3>
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
            can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
            us if you'd like to find out more about how you can get involved.
